> Paladin, Oath of Vengeance

## Specie: Dragonborn

The ancestors of dragonborn hatched from the eggs of chromatic and metallic dragons. One story holds that these eggs were blessed by the dragon gods Bahamut and Tiamat, who wanted to populate the multiverse with people created in their image. Another story claims that dragons created the first dragonborn without the gods’ blessings. Whatever their origin, dragonborn have made homes for themselves on the Material Plane.

Dragonborn look like wingless, bipedal dragons — scaly, bright-eyed, and thick-boned with horns on their heads — and their coloration and other features are reminiscent of their draconic ancestors.

### Dragonborn Traits

## Subclass: Oath of Vengeance

> Punish Evildoers at Any Cost

The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed grievously evil acts. When evil armies slaughter helpless villagers, when a tyrant defies the will of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent, when a dragon rampages through the countryside—at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right what has gone wrong.

These paladins share the following tenets:

- Show the wicked no mercy.
- Fight injustice and its causes.
- Aid those harmed by injustice.

## Background: Sage

You spent your formative years traveling between manors and monasteries, performing various odd jobs and services in exchange for access to their libraries. You whiled away many a long evening studying books and scrolls, learning the lore of the multiverse—even the rudiments of magic—and your mind yearns for more.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, History
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Calligrapher's Supplies

## Character Details

- **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral

Lawful Neutral individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Someone who follows a disciplined rule of life—and isn't swayed either by the demands of those in need or by the temptations of evil—is probably Lawful Neutral.

- **Faith:** Helm, god of protection

Helm, also known as the Vigilant One and The Watcher, was the god of guardians, protection, and protectors. He was worshiped by guards and paladins both, long being seen as a cold and focused deity who impartially took the role of defender and sometimes also enforcer.

- **Lifestyle:** Comfortable (2GP)

Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.
