> Paladin, Oath of Vengeance

## Specie: Dragonborn

The ancestors of dragonborn hatched from the eggs of chromatic and metallic dragons. One story holds that these eggs were blessed by the dragon gods Bahamut and Tiamat, who wanted to populate the multiverse with people created in their image. Another story claims that dragons created the first dragonborn without the gods’ blessings. Whatever their origin, dragonborn have made homes for themselves on the Material Plane.

Dragonborn look like wingless, bipedal dragons — scaly, bright-eyed, and thick-boned with horns on their heads — and their coloration and other features are reminiscent of their draconic ancestors.

## Subclass: Oath of Vengeance

> Punish Evildoers at Any Cost

The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed grievously evil acts. When evil armies slaughter helpless villagers, when a tyrant defies the will of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent, when a dragon rampages through the countryside—at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right what has gone wrong.

These paladins share the following tenets:

- Show the wicked no mercy.
- Fight injustice and its causes.
- Aid those harmed by injustice.
